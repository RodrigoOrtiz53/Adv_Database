# Company Context #
  The mock-up company produces frozen meals and delivers to customers.  The main focus of the companies operatinos which I have focused on was primarily around the manager creating delivery routes for the employees to deliver products. An admin page was created to grant access to employees who have the attribute as managers.
## Database Documentation
